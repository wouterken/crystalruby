`crystalruby` is a gem that allows you to write Crystal code, inlined in Ruby. All you need is a modern crystal compiler installed on your system.

You can then turn simple methods into Crystal methods as easily as demonstrated below:

```ruby
require 'crystalruby'

module MyTestModule
  # The below method will be replaced by a compiled Crystal version
  # linked using FFI.
  crystalize [a: :int, b: :int] => :int
  def add(a, b)
    a + b
  end
end

# This method is run in Crystal, not Ruby!
MyTestModule.add(1, 2) # => 3
```

With as small a change as this, you should be able to see a significant increase in performance for some Ruby code.
E.g.

```ruby

require 'crystalruby'
require 'benchmark'

module PrimeCounter
  crystalize [n: :int32] => :int32
  def count_primes_upto_cr(n)
    primes = 0
    (2..n).each do |i|
      is_prime = true
      (2..Math.sqrt(i).to_i).each do |j|
        if i % j == 0
          is_prime = false
          break
        end
      end
      primes += 1
    end
    primes
  end

  module_function

  def count_primes_upto_rb(n)
    primes = 0
    (2..n).each do |i|
      is_prime = true
      (2..Math.sqrt(i).to_i).each do |j|
        if i % j == 0
          is_prime = false
          break
        end
      end
      primes += 1
    end
    primes
  end
end

include PrimeCounter
puts(Benchmark.realtime { count_primes_upto_rb(1000_000) })
puts(Benchmark.realtime { count_primes_upto_cr(1000_000) })
```

```bash
2.8195170001126826 # Ruby
0.3402599999681115 # Crystal
```

_Note_: The first run of the Crystal code will be slower, as it needs to compile the code first. The subsequent runs will be much faster.

You can call embedded crystal code, from within other embedded crystal code.
E.g.

```ruby
module Cache

  crystalize [key: :string] => :string
  def redis_get(key)
    rds = Redis::Client.new
    value = rds.get(key).to_s
  end

  crystalize [key: :string, value: :string] => :string
  def redis_set_and_return(key, value)
    redis = Redis::Client.new
    redis.set(key, value)
    Cache.redis_get(key)
  end
end
Cache.redis_set_and_return('test', 'abc')
puts Cache.redis_get('test')
```

```bash
$ abc
```

## Syntax

### Ruby Compatible

Where the Crystal syntax is also valid Ruby syntax, you can just write Ruby.
It'll be compiled as Crystal automatically.

E.g.

```ruby
crystalize [a: :int, b: :int] => :int
def add(a, b)
  puts "Adding #{a} and #{b}"
  a + b
end
```

### Crystal Compatible

Some Crystal syntax is not valid Ruby, for methods of this form, we need to
define our functions using a raw: true option

```ruby
crystalize [a: :int, b: :int] => :int, raw: true
def add(a, b)
  <<~CRYSTAL
    c = 0_u64
    a + b + c
  CRYSTAL
end
```

## Getting Started

The below is a stand-alone one-file script that allows you to quickly see crystalruby in action.

```ruby
# crystalrubytest.rb
require 'bundler/inline'

gemfile do
  source 'https://rubygems.org'
  gem 'crystalruby'
end

require 'crystalruby'

module Adder
  crystalize [a: :int, b: :int] => :int
  def add(a, b)
    a + b
  end
end

puts Adder.add(1, 2)
```

## Types

Currently primitive types are supported.
Composite types are supported using JSON serialization.
C-Structures are a WIP.
To see the list of currently supported primitive type mappings of FFI types to crystal types, you can check: `CrystalRuby::Typemaps::CRYSTAL_TYPE_MAP`
E.g.

```ruby
CrystalRuby::Typemaps::CRYSTAL_TYPE_MAP
=> {:char=>"Int8",
 :uchar=>"UInt8",
 :int8=>"Int8",
 :uint8=>"UInt8",
 :short=>"Int16",
 :ushort=>"UInt16",
 :int16=>"Int16",
 :uint16=>"UInt16",
 :int=>"Int32",
 :uint=>"UInt32",
 :int32=>"Int32",
 :uint32=>"UInt32",
 :long=>"Int32 | Int64",
 :ulong=>"UInt32 | UInt64",
 :int64=>"Int64",
 :uint64=>"UInt64",
 :long_long=>"Int64",
 :ulong_long=>"UInt64",
 :float=>"Float32",
 :double=>"Float64",
 :bool=>"Bool",
 :void=>"Void",
 :string=>"String"}
```

## Composite Types (using JSON serialization)

The library allows you to pass complex nested structures using JSON as a serialization format.
The type signatures for composite types can use ordinary Crystal Type syntax.
Type conversion is applied automatically.

E.g.

```ruby
crystalize [a: json{ Int64 | Float64 | Nil }, b: json{ String | Array(Bool)  } ] => :void
def complex_argument_types
  puts "Got #{a} and #{b}"
end

crystalize [] => json{ Int32 | String | Hash(String, Array(NamedTuple(hello: Int32)) | Time)}
def complex_return_type
  return {
    "hello" => [
      {
        hello: 1,
      },
    ],
    "world" => Time.utc
  }
end
```

Type signatures validations are applied to both arguments and return types.

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> Foo.complex_argument_types(nil, "test")
Got  and test
=> nil

[2] pry(main)> Foo.complex_argument_types(88, [true, false, true])
Got 88 and [true, false, true]
=> nil

[3] pry(main)> Foo.complex_argument_types(88, [true, false, 88])
ArgumentError: Expected Bool but was Int at line 1, column 15
from crystalruby.rb:303:in `block in compile!'
```

## Named Types

You can name your types, for more succinct method signatures.
The type names will be mirrored in the generated Crystal code.
E.g.

```ruby

IntArrOrBoolArr = crtype{ Array(Bool) | Array(Int32) }

crystalize [a: IntArrOrBoolArr] => json{ IntArrOrBoolArr }
def method_with_named_types(a)
  return a
end
```

## Exceptions

Exceptions thrown in Crystal code can be caught in Ruby.

## Installing shards and writing non-embedded Crystal code

You can use any Crystal shards and write ordinary, stand-alone Crystal code.

The default entry point for the crystal shared library generated by the gem is
inside `./crystalruby/src/main.cr`. This file is not automatically overridden by the gem, and is safe for you to define and require new files relative to this location to write additional stand-alone Crystal code.

You can define shards inside `./crystalruby/src/shard.yml`
Run the below to install new shards

```bash
bundle exec crystalruby install
```

Remember to require these installed shards after installing them. E.g. inside `./crystalruby/src/main.cr`

You can edit the default paths for crystal source and library files from within the `./crystalruby.yaml` config file.

## Wrapping Crystal code in Ruby

Sometimes you may want to wrap a Crystal method in Ruby, so that you can use Ruby before the Crystal code to prepare arguments, or after the Crystal code, to apply transformations to the result. A real-life example of this might be an ActionController method, where you might want to use Ruby to parse the request, perform auth etc., and then use Crystal to perform some heavy computation, before returning the result from Ruby.
To do this, you simply pass a block to the `crystalize` method, which will serve as the Ruby entry point to the function. From within this block, you can invoke `super` to call the Crystal method, and then apply any Ruby transformations to the result.

```ruby
module MyModule
  crystalize [a: :int32, b: :int32] => :int32 do |a, b|
    # In this example, we perform automated conversion to integers inside Ruby.
    # Then add 1 to the result of the Crystal method.
    result = super(a.to_i, b.to_i)
    result + 1
  end
  def add(a, b)
    a + b
  end
end

MyModule.add("1", "2")
```

## Inline Chunks

`crystalruby` also allows you to write inline Crystal code that does not require binding to Ruby. This can be useful for e.g. performing setup or teardown operations.

Follow these steps for a toy example of how we can use crystalized ruby and inline chunks to expose the [crystal-redis](https://github.com/stefanwille/crystal-redis) library to Ruby.

1. Start our toy project

```bash
mkdir crystalredis
cd crystalredis
bundle init
```

2. Add dependencies to our Gemfile and run `bundle install`

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

source "https://rubygems.org"

gem 'crystalruby'

# Let's see if performance is comparable to that of the redis gem.
gem 'benchmark-ips'
gem 'redis'
```

3. Write our Redis client

```ruby
# Filename: crystalredis.rb
require 'crystalruby'

module CrystalRedis

  crystal do
    CLIENT = Redis.new
    def self.client
      CLIENT
    end
  end

  crystalize [key: :string, value: :string] => :void
  def set(key, value)
    client.set(key, value)
  end

  crystalize [key: :string] => :string
  def get(key)
    client.get(key).to_s
  end
end
```

4. Load the modules (without running them) to generate our Crystal project skeleton.

```bash
bundle exec ruby crystalredis.rb
```

5. Add the missing Redis dependency to our shard.yml

```yaml
# filename:  crystalruby/src/shard.yml
dependencies:
  redis:
    github: stefanwille/crystal-redis
```

```ruby
# filename: main.cr
require "redis"
require "./generated/index"
```

```bash
bundle exec crystalruby install
```

6. Compile and benchmark our new module in Ruby

```ruby
# Filename: benchmark.rb
# Let's compare the performance of our CrystalRedis module to the Ruby Redis gem
require_relative "crystalredis"
require 'redis'
require 'benchmark/ips'

Benchmark.ips do |x|
  rbredis = Redis.new

  x.report(:crredis) do
    CrystalRedis.set("hello", "world")
    CrystalRedis.get("hello")
  end

  x.report(:rbredis) do
    rbredis.set("hello", "world")
    rbredis.get("hello")
  end
end
```

7. Run the benchmark

```bash
$ bundle exec ruby benchmark.rb
```

### Output

```bash

#crystalredis wins! (Warm up during first run will be slow for crredis, due to first compilation)

ruby 3.3.0 (2023-12-25 revision 5124f9ac75) [arm64-darwin22]

```

## Release Builds

You can control whether CrystalRuby builds in debug or release mode by setting following config option

```ruby
CrystalRuby.configure do |config|
  config.debug = false
end
```

By default, Crystal code is only JIT compiled. In production, you likely want to compile the Crystal code ahead of time. To do this, you can create a dedicated file which

- Preloads all files Ruby code with embedded crystal
- Forces compilation.

E.g.

```ruby
# E.g. crystalruby_build.rb
require "crystalruby"

CrystalRuby.configure do |config|
  config.debug = false
end

require_relative "foo"
require_relative "bar"

CrystalRuby.compile!
```

Then you can run this file as part of your build step, to ensure all Crystal code is compiled ahead of time.

## Concurrency

While Ruby programs allow multi-threading, Crystal by default uses only a single thread, while utilising Fiber based cooperative-multitasking to allow for concurrent execution. This means that by default, Crystal libraries can not safely be invoked in parallel across multiple Ruby threads.

To safely expose this behaviour, `crystalruby` implements a Reactor, which multiplexes all Ruby calls to Crystal across a single thread. This way you can safely use `crystalruby` in a multi-threaded Ruby environment.

By default `crystalruby` methods are blocking/synchronous, this means that for blocking operations, a single crystalruby call can block the entire reactor.

To allow you to benefit from Crystal's fiber based concurrency, you can use use the `async` option on crystalized ruby methods. This allows several Ruby threads to invoke Crystal code simultaneously.

E.g.

```ruby
module Sleeper
  crystalize [] => :void
  def sleep_sync
    sleep 2
  end

  crystalize [] => :void, async: true
  def sleep_async
    sleep 2
  end
end
```

```ruby
5.times.map{ Thread.new{ Sleeper.sleep_sync } }.each(&:join) # Will take 10 seconds
5.times.map{ Thread.new{ Sleeper.sleep_async } }.each(&:join) # Will take 2 seconds (the sleeps are processed concurrently)
```

### Reactor performance

There is a small amount of overhead to multiplexing calls across a single thread. Ad-hoc testing amounts this to be around 10 nanoseconds per call.
For most use-cases this overhead is negligible, especially if the bulk of your CPU heavy task occurs exclusively in Crystal code. However, if you are invoking very fast Crystal code from Ruby in a tight loop (e.g. a simple 1 + 2)
then the overhead of the reactor can become significant.

In this case you can use the `crystalruby` in a single-threaded mode to avoid the reactor overhead and greatly increase performance, with the caveat that _all_ calls to Crystal must occur from a single thread. If you Ruby program is already single-threaded this is not a problem.

```ruby
CrystalRuby.configure do |config|
  config.single_thread_mode = true
end
```

## Troubleshooting

The logic to detect when to JIT recompile is not robust and can end up in an inconsistent state. To remedy this it is useful to clear out all generated assets and build from scratch.

To do this execute:

```bash
bundle exec crystalruby clean
```

## Design Goals

`crystalruby`'s primary purpose is to provide ergonomic access to Crystal from Ruby, over FFI.
For simple usage, advanced knowledge of Crystal should not be required.

However, the abstraction it provides should remain simple, transparent, and easy to hack on and it should not preclude users from supplementing its capabilities with a more direct integration using ffi primtives.

It should support escape hatches to allow it to coexist with code that performs a more direct [FFI](https://github.com/ffi/ffi) integration to implement advanced functionality not supported by `crystalruby`.

The library is currently in its infancy. Planned additions are:

- Simple mixin/concern that utilises `FFI::Struct` for bi-directional passing of Ruby objects and Crystal objects (by value).
- Install command to generate a sample build script, and supports build command (which simply verifies then invokes this script)
- Call Ruby from Crystal using FFI callbacks (implement `.expose_to_crystal`)
- Support long-lived synchronized objects (through use of synchronized memory arena to prevent GC).
- Support for passing `crystalruby` types by reference (need to contend with GC).
- Explore mechanisms to safely expose true parallelism using [FFI over Ractors](https://github.com/ffi/ffi/wiki/Ractors)

## Installation

To get started, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'crystalruby'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install crystalruby
```

`crystalruby` supports some basic configuration options, which can be specified inside a crystalruby.yaml file in the root of your project.
You can run `crystalruby init` to generate a configuration file with sane defaults.

```bash
crystalruby init
```

```yaml
crystal_src_dir: "./crystalruby/src"
crystal_lib_dir: "./crystalruby/lib"
crystal_main_file: "main.cr"
crystal_lib_name: "crlib"
crystal_codegen_dir: "generated"
debug: true
```

Alternatively, these can be set programmatically, e.g:

```ruby
CrystalRuby.configure do |config|
  config.crystal_src_dir = "./crystalruby/src"
  config.crystal_lib_dir = "./crystalruby/lib"
  config.crystal_main_file = "main.cr"
  config.crystal_lib_name = "crlib"
  config.crystal_codegen_dir = "generated"
  config.debug = true
  config.verbose = false
  config.colorize_log_output = false
  config.log_level = :info
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
